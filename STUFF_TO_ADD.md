# My ideas to add

- A button to dodge attacks
- A map that you can get for free from a shopkeeper
- Quests that lead to me getting companions that fight for me like sages in totk
- Places where you can get more health
- Places to get more health/stamina/magic potions
- Quests that lead to better stuff
- Hard bosses e.g. ones that can heal themselves everytime they get hit or bosses that turn invisible
