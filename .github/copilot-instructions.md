## About Me

- I’m 11 years old and this is my very first time programming.
- I’m using Python and Pygame to learn by making a game.
- I need clear, beginner-friendly explanations with simple code and comments.

## Game Overview

- The game is a **2D top-down maze/adventure** (kind of like Zelda).
- The **player** is a red circle you move with keys.
- The **enemies** are green pigs that can chase the player.
- Both the player and enemies can have swords and health.
- The game runs in a loop that updates movement, combat, and drawing.

## Current Features

- Player movement with keys.
- Enemy pigs that follow the player when close.
- Health system with bars above enemies.
- Simple sword combat that does damage.
- Basic HUD text to show health.

## Goals / Next Steps

- Add game over or win screens.
- Add knockback when characters get hit.
- Add more enemies, levels, and maze walls.
- Add items, coins, or keys like Zelda.

## Notes for Copilot

- Keep code simple and easy to understand.
- Add comments so I know what each part does.
- Build features step by step.
- Explain changes in kid-friendly language.
